github-backup-utils (1.1.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Updated documentation on minimum GitHub Enterprise version requirements for
    online and incremental backups from v11.10.341 to at least v11.10.342.
  * The ghe-restore command now prompts for confirmation of the host to restore to

    by providing the --force option.
  * Added a -c option to ghe-restore for restoring base appliance settings in
    addition to primary datastores. See ghe-restore --help for more information.
  * Added a note about disabling maintenance mode on the appliance after a
    successful ghe-restore operation.
